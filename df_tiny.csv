2,5.0,Ett mycket bra hotell. Det som drog ner betyget var att vi fick ett rum under taksarna dr det endast var full sthjd i 80 av rummets yta.,136,"('sv', 1)",A very good hotel. What pulled down the grade was that we got a room under the taxis where there was only full support in 80 of the room&#39;s surface.

The rooms were clean and comfortable- good shower, light and airy rooms with windows you could open wide. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of choice for breakfast.Spa at hotel nearby which we used while we were there.",354,"('en', 1)","We stayed here for four nights in October.

4,5.0,"We loved staying on the island of Lido! You need to take a water is from Venice to get there. From the train station, a boat ride takes 45 minutes but has beautiful views along the way. Hotel is an EASY walk from the boat dock. The room was very clean and the breakfast was plentiful. We would definitely recommend this hotel!",326,"('en', 1)","We loved staying on the island of Lido!
